                    Newcastle developed around a Roman settlement called Pons Aelius. 
                    The settlement became known as Monkchester before taking on the name of a castle built in 1080 by William the Conqueror's eldest son, Robert Curthose. 
                    It was one of the world's largest ship building and repair centres during the industrial revolution.
                     Newcastle was part of the county of Northumberland until 1400, when it separated and formed a county of itself.
                     In 1974, Newcastle became part of Tyne and Wear.

                    The city has a strong sporting tradition. Football club Newcastle United has been based at St James' Park since the club was established in 1892,
                     although any traces of the original structure are now long gone as the stadium now holds more than 52,000 seated spectators,
                      being England's seventh largest football stadium.
                     The city also has non-League football clubs, Newcastle Benfield, West Allotment Celtic, Team Northumbria and Heaton Stannington. 
                     Along with the Nationally famous, Great North Run

                    The city has a proud history of theatre. Stephen Kemble of the well-known Kemble family managed the original Theatre Royal, Newcastle for fifteen years (1791â€“1806).
                     He brought members of his famous acting family such as Sarah Siddons and John Kemble out of London to Newcastle. 
                     Stephen Kemble guided the theatre through many celebrated seasons. The original Theatre Royal in Newcastle was opened on 21 January 1788 and was located on Mosley Street.
                     It was demolished to make way for Grey Street, where its replacement was built.

                    In 2010, Newcastle was positioned ninth in the retail centre expenditure league of the UK. There are several major shopping areas in Newcastle City Centre.
                        The largest of these is the Eldon Square Shopping Centre, one of the largest city centre shopping complexes in the UK. It has one of the largest John Lewis & Partners stores in the UK.
                        This John Lewis branch was formerly known as Bainbridge, established in 1838, often cited as the world's first department store.
