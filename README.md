### Design
 <h2 align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme//NUFCTOP.webp">

 - A simple colour palette for the site based off the NUFC Football teams  Home colours.
 - The Footer colour also keep this pattern with a black background with white texts and icons

 ### typography 

 - Headings along with body texts are in oswald as i feel it's a smart and professional looking font that conveys information well.

 ### imagary 

 - Imagery is a very important feature of the website, as the website needs to appeal visually to users and represent the City in a good light.

 ### Icons 

 -  used icons from Font Awesome to encourage users to click on buttons and to add clear visual indicators to sections on the About page.

 ## Future Features

### Events
- There could be an events section with a booking form, allowing users to book tickets for upcoming events.
